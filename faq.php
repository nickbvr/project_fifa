                    risks are minimized. We have the safest algorithm which makes transfers the most ban-protected.
                    There was not a single case of getting banned because of our fault. But we have cases when
                    customers get banned because of their faults, so we can guarantee that you will not get banned
                    in case:

                    You haven't had a suspicious activity on your account.
                    You haven't purchased FIFA coins on suspicious stores with bad transferring ways (For example
                    Player Auction).
                    From our inception, there have been no complaints from customers about bans or freezing from EA.
